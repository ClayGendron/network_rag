# Network RAG

**Precise retrieval with broad context.**

Network RAG is an open-source Python framework that combines vector search with network relationships for precise retrieval with broad context. Define your graph explicitly in code, deploy anywhere with your current database and tech stack, and query with NXQLâ€”a composable query language built for hybrid retrieval.

```python
import network_rag as nxr

# Define your schema with Pydantic
# Query with NXQL
# Deploy anywhere
```

## Core Design Principles

1. **Vector Search + Network Relationships** - Combine the precision of vector search with the contextual power of graph traversal
2. **Bring Your Own Database + Serve Anywhere** - Use in-memory storage for small datasets or persistent databases for large-scale deployments
3. **Built-in Functions + Composable Query Language** - Get started in seconds with built-in functions, or customize with a powerful DSL

## Features (Planned)

- **Pydantic-based Schema Definition** - Define your document and relationship schemas with Pydantic models
- **Flexible Storage Backends** - In-memory for development, SQL/Vector databases for production
- **NXQL Query Language** - Composable query language built for hybrid retrieval with vector and graph operations
- **MLflow Integration** - Deploy as an MLflow model for easy serving
- **HTTP API** - RESTful API for query execution and model serving
