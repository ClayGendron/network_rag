# NetworkX RAG - Development Plan

## Project Vision

NetworkX RAG (Network RAG) is a novel approach to Retrieval-Augmented Generation that combines the precision of vector similarity search with the contextual power of graph network relationships. Unlike traditional Graph RAG implementations that use LLMs to extract entities and relationships, Network RAG uses directed graphs with NetworkX to model document relationships explicitly, enabling both precise retrieval and broad contextual understanding.

## Core Design Principles

1. **Vector Search + Network Relationships**
   - Combine vector embeddings for semantic similarity with graph traversal for contextual relationships
   - Enable queries that leverage both "what's similar?" and "what's connected?"

2. **Bring Your Own Database + Serve Anywhere**
   - In-memory storage for small datasets and rapid prototyping
   - Persistent database backends (DuckDB, SQL) for large-scale production deployments
   - Deploy as MLflow model, Docker container, or standalone FastAPI service

3. **Built-in Functions + Composable Query Language**
   - Quick-start functions for common patterns (get started in seconds)
   - Powerful DSL (Domain-Specific Language) inspired by Cypher but extended for vector operations
   - Composable queries that can be executed via Python API or HTTP endpoints

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| DSL complexity too high | Low adoption | Start with simple syntax, iterate based on feedback |
| Performance bottlenecks | User churn | Benchmark early, optimize hot paths, provide profiling tools |
| Database backend complexity | Delayed launch | Ship in-memory first, add backends incrementally |
| Limited differentiation from existing solutions | Low adoption | Clear messaging on unique value prop, strong examples |

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 4-6 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 3-4 weeks (can be done incrementally post-launch)
- **Phase 6**: Ongoing, start after Phase 1

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: Phases 1-3 (10-14 weeks)
**Production Ready**: Phases 1-4 (15-20 weeks)

## Next Steps

1. Validate this plan with potential users and contributors
2. Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
3. Create project board to track progress
4. Begin Phase 1.1: Schema definition with Pydantic
5. Create initial examples to validate design decisions
